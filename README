NAME
====
       Template::Plugin::Filter::MinifyHTML - HTML minification filter for Template Toolkit

VERSION
=======
       version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
========
         [% USE Filter.MinifyHTML( comments => 1, html5 => 1 ) %]

         [% FILTER minify_html %]
         <html>...Your html content here...</html>
         [% END %]

DESCRIPTION
===========
       This is a Template Toolkit filter which uses a few quick and nasty regexes to minify HTML source code. It’s built upon the idea/workings
       of the default ’collapse’ filter, but adds a little spice of its own into the mix, removing HTML comments and a few other bits and
       pieces.

BUYER BEWARE
============
       This filter does not check for or acknowledge the existence or importance of tags such as <pre> or <textarea>. As such, any whitespace
       within these tags *WILL* be royally messed up by this module in its current state.

SEE ALSO
========
